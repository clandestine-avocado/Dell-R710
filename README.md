iDRAC6 Express
1. Reset iDRAC6 to factory defaults
   -  CTR-E during boot, nav to the rest option
   -  ![plot](./Dell-R710/pics/1.0_iDRAC Reset.png)
   -  Reboot, and IP shows the default of [192.168.0.120](http://192.168.0.120/)
   -  Also shows default gateway of 192.168.X.X; Could this be a problem, because mine gateway is [192.168.1.1](192.168.1.1)

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks

+ Or pluses
